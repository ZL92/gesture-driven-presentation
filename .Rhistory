### JS Package Development!
Use this only to modify javascript code. Install node and yarn first.
The js files in [javascript_pose_estimation](javascript_pose_estimation) contain the pose estimation code. Once changes are made run,
```
python prep_dist.py
```
The prep_dist file runs yarn build and also replaces the generated files with directory structure required by tornado.
Then the detector_api.py can be run and the new javascript code will be reflected.
